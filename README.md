CALCULATOR:
The provided code is a simple Python program that creates a calculator with buttons and a display. It uses a graphical interface library called Tkinter. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Setting Up the Calculator Window:

The program creates a window for the calculator with a specific size, title, and background color.
Global Variable:

There's a variable called equation that stores the user's input (mathematical expression).
Functions:

show(value): Adds the clicked button's value to the input display.
clear(): Clears the input display.
calculate(): Evaluates the expression and shows the result.
Display Label:

There's an area at the top of the calculator that shows the input expression and the result.
Creating Buttons:

The calculator has buttons for digits, basic operations (+, -, *, /), and special symbols (% and .).
Each button is set up to perform a specific action when clicked.
Main Loop:

The program enters a loop that keeps the calculator window open and responsive to user interactions.
Styling:

Buttons and the display area are styled with specific colors, sizes, and fonts to make the calculator look visually appealing.
In simpler terms, the code makes a calculator that you can interact with using buttons. It shows your inputs and the results on a screen, and you can perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME :
The provided code is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python and Tkinter, a graphical user interface library. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Game Logic:

The game logic is defined in a dictionary called schema, which determines the outcomes of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It specifies the results when the player chooses one option against the computer's choice.
Variables:

Variables comp_score and player_score keep track of the computer's and player's scores, respectively.
Outcome Handler Function:

The outcome_handler function manages the game outcomes. It randomly selects the computer's choice, compares it with the player's choice, and updates the scores and outcome labels accordingly.
GUI Setup:

The Tkinter window is created with the title "RPS" (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
Labels are used to display the game title, score for the player and computer, player and computer choices, and the game outcome.
Buttons:

Three buttons are provided for the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Each button is associated with the outcome_handler function, passing the corresponding choice as an argument.
Main Loop:

The Tkinter event loop (mainloop()) keeps the GUI window open and responsive.
Label Styling:

Labels are formatted with specific fonts, sizes, and colors to make the interface clear.
In simpler terms, this code creates a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player can make a choice, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game rules and updates the scores and outcome display on the graphical interface. Players can play multiple rounds by clicking on the provided buttons.

TO-DO-LIST:
This Python program creates a simple to-do list application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The application allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, load tasks from a file, and save tasks to a file.

Key Features:

Task List Display: The main window contains a list box that displays the existing tasks. Users can scroll through the list using a scrollbar on the right.

Add Task: Users can input tasks in the entry field provided and click the "CLICK TO ADD TASK" button. If the input is not empty, the task is added to the list. Otherwise, a warning message is displayed.

Remove Task: Users can select a task from the list and click the "CLICK TO DELETE TASK" button to remove the selected task. If no task is selected, a warning message is displayed.

Load and Save Tasks: The program provides buttons to load tasks from a file ("CLICK TO LOAD TASK") and save tasks to a file ("CLICK TO SAVE TASK"). If the file is not found during the load operation, a warning message is displayed.

Usage:

Enter a task in the entry field.
Click "CLICK TO ADD TASK" to add the task to the list.
Select a task and click "CLICK TO DELETE TASK" to remove it.
Use "CLICK TO LOAD TASK" to load tasks from a file.
Use "CLICK TO SAVE TASK" to save the current tasks to a file.
Note:

Make sure to have the 'pickle' module available in your Python environment for loading and saving tasks.
The program saves tasks to a file named "tasks.dat" in the current working directory.
The GUI is designed with colorful buttons for each action, making it easy for users to interact with the to-do list application.
